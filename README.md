# WordCounter
Implement a program to count the frequency of words in a text file. The text file is partitioned into N segments. Each segment is processed by a separate thread that out- puts the intermediate frequency count for its segment. The main process waits until all the threads complete; then it computes the consolidated word-frequency data based on the individual threadsâ€™ output
